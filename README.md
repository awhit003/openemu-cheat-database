# OpenEmu Cheat Database

[OpenEmu] cheat database for games I play. Since OpenEmu doesn't (yet) support persisting cheats, this is my backup of the `cheats-database.xml` file with my own customizations.

Released as public domain, _The Unlicense_, or _Creative Commons Zero (CC0)_ â€” whichever is most permissive according to the copyright laws in your country.

## Added Games

This is _itch-and-scratch-ware_. I had an itch. I scratched it. I stopped scratching when the itch stopped itching.

* [GBA] Final Fantasy Tactics Advance
