# OpenEmu Cheat Database

[OpenEmu] cheat database for games I play. Since OpenEmu doesn't (yet) support persisting cheats, this is my backup of the `cheats-database.xml` file with my own customizations.

Released as public domain, _The Unlicense_, or _Creative Commons Zero (CC0)_ — whichever is most permissive according to the copyright laws in your country.

## Usage

1. Find _OpenEmu.app_ in the Finder, probably inside `/Applications`.
1. Right-click (or Ctrl-click) on the app, and choose _Show Package Contents_.
1. Go inside _Contents_ → _Resources_.
1. Copy `cheats-database.xml` from this repo into that folder.
1. Replace the existing file.
1. Restart OpenEmu (if it were running).

## Added Games

This is _itch-and-scratch-ware_. I had an itch. I scratched it. I stopped scratching when the itch stopped itching.

* [GBA] Final Fantasy Tactics Advance
